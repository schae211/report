Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/schae211/report/tree/84b18a7c73cd626797e5a6d7bfd82af1b9dd53d8" target="_blank">84b18a7</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This document is supposed to show how the new implementation can be useful in the case of a neighborhood composition analysis. Meaning whether we can predict the identiy of a cell type using the neighboring cell types.</p>
<p>However, after updating the MISTy meta model from linear regression to ridge regression, MISTy is not able to learn something from the spatial context anymore.</p>
