Here we investigate the spatial organization and transcriptional profile of individual cells in both wild type (WT) and Tet2−/− fetal livers, by multiplexed error robust fluorescence in situ hybridization. We find that specific pairs of fetal liver cell types are preferentially positioned next to each other. Ligand-receptor signaling molecule pairs such as Kitl and Kit are enriched in neighboring cell types. The majority of HSCs are in direct contact with endothelial cells (ECs) in both WT and Tet2−/− fetal livers. Loss of Tet2 increases the number of HSCs, and upregulates Wnt and Notch signaling genes in the HSC niche. Two subtypes of ECs, arterial ECs and sinusoidal ECs, and other cell types contribute distinct signaling molecules to the HSC niche. Collectively, this study provides a comprehensive picture and bioinformatic foundation for HSC spatial regulation in fetal liver.}},

MISTy can be applied to different spatially resolved omics data with dozens to thousands of markers, without the need to perform cell-type annotation. We evaluate the performance of MISTy on an in silico dataset and demonstrate its applicability on three breast cancer datasets, two measured by imaging mass cytometry and one by Visium spatial transcriptomics. We show how we can estimate interactions coming from different spatial contexts that we can relate to tumor progression and clinical features. Our analysis also reveals that the estimated interactions in triple negative breast cancer are associated with clinical outcomes which could improve patient stratification. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of MISTy to integrate different kinds of views by modeling activities of pathways estimated from gene expression in a spatial context to analyse intercellular signaling.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

These image-based approaches naturally preserve the native spatial context of RNAs within a cell and the organization of cells within tissue, which are important for addressing many biological questions. However, the throughput of these image-based approaches is relatively low. Here we report advances that lead to a drastic increase in the measurement throughput of multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), an image-based approach to single-cell transcriptomics. In MERFISH, RNAs are identified via a combinatorial labeling approach that encodes RNA species with error-robust barcodes followed by sequential rounds of single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) to read out these barcodes. Here we increase the throughput of MERFISH by two orders of magnitude through a combination of improvements, including using chemical cleavage instead of photobleaching to remove fluorescent signals between consecutive rounds of smFISH imaging, increasing the imaging field of view, and using multicolor imaging. With these improvements, we performed RNA profiling in more than 100,000 human cells, with as many as 40,000 cells measured in a single 18-h measurement. This throughput should substantially extend the range of biological questions that can be addressed by MERFISH.}},

We identified distinct layers in the dentate gyrus corresponding to the granule cell layer and the subgranular zone and, contrary to previous reports, discovered that distinct subregions within the CA1 and CA3 are composed of unique combinations of cells in different transcriptional states.

To gain spatial information, we have coupled immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical methods with high-resolution laser ablation to CyTOF mass cytometry. This approach enables the simultaneous imaging of 32 proteins and protein modifications at subcellular resolution; with the availability of additional isotopes, measurement of over 100 markers will be possible. We applied imaging mass cytometry to human breast cancer samples, allowing delineation of cell subpopulations and cell-cell interactions and highlighting tumor heterogeneity.

The approach, used here to image breast tumor tissue sections, offers over a five-log dynamic range and compatibility with standard formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a tool for visualizing protein expression that is employed as part of the diagnostic workup for the majority of solid tissue malignancies. Existing IHC methods use antibodies tagged with fluorophores or enzyme reporters that generate colored pigments. Because these reporters exhibit spectral and spatial overlap when used simultaneously, multiplexed IHC is not routinely used in clinical settings. We have developed a method that uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to image antibodies tagged with isotopically pure elemental metal reporters. Multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) is capable of analyzing up to 100 targets simultaneously over a five-log dynamic range.

	abstract = {Tissue niches are sources of cellular variation and key to understanding both single-cell and tissue phenotypes. The interaction of a cell with its niche can be described through cell communication events. These events cannot be directly observed in molecular profiling assays of single cells and have to be inferred. However, computational models of cell communication and variance attribution defined on data from dissociated tissues suffer from multiple limitations with respect to their ability to define and to identify communication events. We address these limitations using spatial molecular profiling data with node-centric expression modeling (NCEM), a computational method based on graph neural networks which reconciles variance attribution and communication modeling in a single model of tissue niches. We use these models in varying complexity across spatial assays, such as immunohistochemistry and MERFISH, and biological systems to demonstrate that the statistical cell{\textendash}cell dependencies discovered by NCEM are plausible signatures of known molecular processes underlying cell communication. We identify principles of tissue organisation as cell communication events across multiple datasets using interpretation mechanisms. In the primary motor cortex, we found gene expression variation that is due to niche composition variation across cortical depth. Using the same approach, we also identified niche-dependent cell state variation in CD8 T cells from inflamed colon and colorectal cancer. Finally, we show that NCEMs can be extended to mixed models of explicit cell communication events and latent intrinsic sources of variation in conditional variational autoencoders to yield holistic models of cellular variation in spatial molecular profiling data. Altogether, this graphical model of cellular niches is a step towards understanding emergent tissue phenotypes.Competing Interest StatementF.J.T. reports receiving consulting fees from Cellarity Inc., and ownership interest in Cellarity, Inc. and Dermagnostix.},
