Here we investigate the spatial organization and transcriptional profile of individual cells in both wild type (WT) and Tet2−/− fetal livers, by multiplexed error robust fluorescence in situ hybridization. We find that specific pairs of fetal liver cell types are preferentially positioned next to each other. Ligand-receptor signaling molecule pairs such as Kitl and Kit are enriched in neighboring cell types. The majority of HSCs are in direct contact with endothelial cells (ECs) in both WT and Tet2−/− fetal livers. Loss of Tet2 increases the number of HSCs, and upregulates Wnt and Notch signaling genes in the HSC niche. Two subtypes of ECs, arterial ECs and sinusoidal ECs, and other cell types contribute distinct signaling molecules to the HSC niche.

MISTy can be applied to different spatially resolved omics data with dozens to thousands of markers, without the need to perform cell-type annotation. We evaluate the performance of MISTy on an in silico dataset and demonstrate its applicability on three breast cancer datasets, two measured by imaging mass cytometry and one by Visium spatial transcriptomics. We show how we can estimate interactions coming from different spatial contexts that we can relate to tumor progression and clinical features. Our analysis also reveals that the estimated interactions in triple negative breast cancer are associated with clinical outcomes which could improve patient stratification.

These image-based approaches naturally preserve the native spatial context of RNAs within a cell and the organization of cells within tissue, which are important for addressing many biological questions. However, the throughput of these image-based approaches is relatively low. Here we report advances that lead to a drastic increase in the measurement throughput of multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), an image-based approach to single-cell transcriptomics. In MERFISH, RNAs are identified via a combinatorial labeling approach that encodes RNA species with error-robust barcodes followed by sequential rounds of single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) to read out these barcodes. Here we increase the throughput of MERFISH by two orders of magnitude through a combination of improvements, including using chemical cleavage instead of photobleaching to remove fluorescent signals between consecutive rounds of smFISH imaging, increasing the imaging field of view, and using multicolor imaging. With these improvements, we performed RNA profiling in more than 100,000 human cells, with as many as 40,000 cells measured in a single 18-h measurement. This throughput should substantially extend the range of biological questions that can be addressed by MERFISH.}},

This approach enables the simultaneous imaging of 32 proteins and protein modifications at subcellular resolution; with the availability of additional isotopes, measurement of over 100 markers will be possible. We applied imaging mass cytometry to human breast cancer samples, allowing delineation of cell subpopulations and cell-cell interactions and highlighting tumor heterogeneity.

The approach, used here to image breast tumor tissue sections, offers over a five-log dynamic range and compatibility with standard formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a tool for visualizing protein expression that is employed as part of the diagnostic workup for the majority of solid tissue malignancies. Existing IHC methods use antibodies tagged with fluorophores or enzyme reporters that generate colored pigments. Because these reporters exhibit spectral and spatial overlap when used simultaneously, multiplexed IHC is not routinely used in clinical settings. We have developed a method that uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to image antibodies tagged with isotopically pure elemental metal reporters. Multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) is capable of analyzing up to 100 targets simultaneously over a five-log dynamic range.

	abstract = {Tissue niches are sources of cellular variation and key to understanding both single-cell and tissue phenotypes. The interaction of a cell with its niche can be described through cell communication events. These events cannot be directly observed in molecular profiling assays of single cells and have to be inferred. However, computational models of cell communication and variance attribution defined on data from dissociated tissues suffer from multiple limitations with respect to their ability to define and to identify communication events. We address these limitations using spatial molecular profiling data with node-centric expression modeling (NCEM), a computational method based on graph neural networks which reconciles variance attribution and communication modeling in a single model of tissue niches. We use these models in varying complexity across spatial assays, such as immunohistochemistry and MERFISH, and biological systems to demonstrate that the statistical cell{\textendash}cell dependencies discovered by NCEM are plausible signatures of known molecular processes underlying cell communication. We identify principles of tissue organisation as cell communication events across multiple datasets using interpretation mechanisms. In the primary motor cortex, we found gene expression variation that is due to niche composition variation across cortical depth. Using the same approach, we also identified niche-dependent cell state variation in CD8 T cells from inflamed colon and colorectal cancer. Finally, we show that NCEMs can be extended to mixed models of explicit cell communication events and latent intrinsic sources of variation in conditional variational autoencoders to yield holistic models of cellular variation in spatial molecular profiling data. Altogether, this graphical model of cellular niches is a step towards understanding emergent tissue phenotypes.Competing Interest StatementF.J.T. reports receiving consulting fees from Cellarity Inc., and ownership interest in Cellarity, Inc. and Dermagnostix.},

abstract = {{The ensemble method random forests has become a popular classification tool in bioinformatics and related fields. The out-of-bag error is an error estimation technique often used to evaluate the accuracy of a random forest and to select appropriate values for tuning parameters, such as the number of candidate predictors that are randomly drawn for a split, referred to as mtry. However, for binary classification problems with metric predictors it has been shown that the out-of-bag error can overestimate the true prediction error depending on the choices of random forests parameters. Based on simulated and real data this paper aims to identify settings for which this overestimation is likely. It is, moreover, questionable whether the out-of-bag error can be used in classification tasks for selecting tuning parameters like mtry, because the overestimation is seen to depend on the parameter mtry. The simulation-based and real-data based studies with metric predictor variables performed in this paper show that the overestimation is largest in balanced settings and in settings with few observations, a large number of predictor variables, small correlations between predictors and weak effects. There was hardly any impact of the overestimation on tuning parameter selection. However, although the prediction performance of random forests was not substantially affected when using the out-of-bag error for tuning parameter selection in the present studies, one cannot be sure that this applies to all future data. For settings with metric predictor variables it is therefore strongly recommended to use stratified subsampling with sampling fractions that are proportional to the class sizes for both tuning parameter selection and error estimation in random forests. This yielded less biased estimates of the true prediction error. In unbalanced settings, in which there is a strong interest in predicting observations from the smaller classes well, sampling the same number of observations from each class is a promising alternative.}},

Readers should have knowledge of basic statistical ideas, such as correlation and linear regression analysis. While the text is biased against complex equations, a mathematical background is needed for advanced topics. Dr. Kuhn is a Director of Non-Clinical Statistics at Pfizer Global R&D in Groton Connecticut. He has been applying predictive models in the pharmaceutical and diagnostic industries for over 15 years and is the author of a number of R packages. Dr. Johnson has more than a decade of statistical consulting and predictive modeling experience in pharmaceutical research and development. He is a co-founder of Arbor Analytics, a firm specializing in predictive modeling and is a former Director of Statistics at Pfizer Global R&D. His scholarly work centers on the application and development of statistical methodology and learning algorithms. Applied Predictive Modeling covers the overall predictive modeling process, beginning with the crucial steps of data preprocessing, data splitting and foundations of model tuning. The text then provides intuitive explanations of numerous common and modern regression and classification techniques, always with an emphasis on illustrating and solving real data problems. Addressing practical concerns extends beyond model fitting to topics such as handling class imbalance, selecting predictors, and pinpointing causes of poor model performance-all of which are problems that occur frequently in practice. The text illustrates all parts of the modeling process through many hands-on, real-life examples. And every chapter contains extensive R code for each step of the process. The data sets and corresponding code are available in the book's companion AppliedPredictiveModeling R package, which is freely available on the CRAN archive. This multi-purpose text can be used as an introduction to predictive models and the overall modeling process, a practitioner's reference handbook, or as a text for advanced undergraduate or graduate level predictive modeling courses. To that end, each chapter contains problem sets to help solidify the covered concepts and uses data available in the book's R package. Readers and students interested in implementing the methods should have some basic knowledge of R. And a handful of the more advanced topics require some mathematical knowledge.},

abstract = {{Dimension-reduction methods, such as t-SNE or UMAP, are widely used when exploring high-dimensional data describing many entities, for example, RNA-seq data for many single cells. However, dimension reduction is commonly prone to introducing artifacts, and we hence need means to see where a dimension-reduced embedding is a faithful representation of the local neighborhood and where it is not. We present Sleepwalk, a simple but powerful tool that allows the user to interactively explore an embedding, using color to depict original or any other distances from all points to the cell under the mouse cursor. We show how this approach not only highlights distortions but also reveals otherwise hidden characteristics of the data, and how Sleepwalk's comparative modes help integrate multisample data and understand differences between embedding and preprocessing methods. Sleepwalk is a versatile and intuitive tool that unlocks the full power of dimension reduction and will be of value not only in single-cell RNA-seq but also in any other area with matrix-shaped big data.}},
