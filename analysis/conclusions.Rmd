# Discussion & Conclusions:

* Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) do not seem to be suited for modeling views within the current framework of MISTy. They are not as scalable as random forest, gradient boosting models, or linear models. Furthermore Multi-layer Perceptrons are very sensitive to hyperparameters and thus would need hyperparameter optimization for each view for each marker which is simply not feasible. The scalability of MISTy is an important feature that allows to quickly explore different parameters for computing views.

* MARS (multivariate adaptive regression splines) are not as scalable as random forests, gradient boosting models, and linear models. Especially when the number of predictors ("markers") increases and the number of possible interaction terms (`degree` hyperparameter) is larger than 1, the performance  of MARS models drops, because in the model building process an increasing number of combinations has to be tested. Subsampling the data only helps a little bit here. More importantly the number of features must be reduced which can be achieved for example by only considering spatially variable markers (e.g. computed with SPARK-X [@10.1186/s13059-021-02404-0]).

* Linear Models are sometimes as good as non-linear models such as random forest or gradient boosting. Thereby, their interpretability and their runtime is much better. It would be benefical what sample characteristics determine whether linear models are suitable or not.

* Comments on approximations

* Comments on time

* See in tests, SVM and MLP and not fully reproducible yet. The results of
different runs are similar but not exactly the same.

# Open Questions & Future Directions:

* How can we focus the MISTy analysis on certain parts of the tissue slides? 
(for example the tumor immune border). And could we incorporate some kind
of comparitive MISTy were we run MISTy "automatically" in two different
regions on the same slide and compare the results we obtained in a meaningful
way (e.g. which interactions are present here but not there.)
